			<p>I remember seeing the trailers for the movie version of this book and being unimpressed. I remain unsure as to what caused me feelings; perhaps it was the art style or the music. </p>
<p>While I was in a book shop for a whole day waiting for my car to be repaired, (a story to be told at another date,) I found a book called The Tale of Despereaux and thought it was time to make amends with the piece of respectable literature &#8211; one does not create a movie based upon literature without a passion for its writing.</p>
<p>After reading a few chapters, I was immensely bored, the scenes felt plodding and overly grandiose for reading&#8217;s sake, and the dialogue and characters felt chunky and overly described. I felt dissapointed; betrayed, even. Was this great literature? I scoffed and closed the book.</p>
<p>However, upon scowling at the cover, I recognized the words every adult reader of children&#8217;s literature is tormented with: &#8220;&#8230;based on the motion picture!&#8221;</p>
<p>I sighed with relief. This, while being the work of a great writer who worked hard at his or her craft, should not be judged as the original work. </p>
<p>Years later, I have come across a preowned version of the original Tale, formerly owned by a mister David Green, who I hope enjoyed this book as much as I did.</p>
<p>My review:</p>
<p>DiCamillo&#8217;s The Tale of Despereaux is not for those who shy from storyteller narrators. The narrator of this story looms over this story, describing the themes in intricate detail for simple-minded readers (also known as anyone who poorly analyzed Shakespeare back in high school). However, descriptions of characters are refreshingly light, giving just enough detail to understand characters without becoming droning and tiresome.</p>
<p>Along with the titular mouse, the story&#8217;s other primary anthropomorphic rat resident, Chiaroscuro (referred to as Roscuro) becomes the villain in a tragic fish out of water/racism is bad series of events, leading him to seek revenge upon Princess Pea using a MacGuffin character known as Migs. The story uses the structure of four separate books, the first three following Des, Roscuro, and Migs wit the fourth chronically the events which bring them all together.</p>
<p>Anthro Content:</p>
<p>Animal Society: The story only anthros Rats and Mice. While other animals are referred to, such as sheep, hens, and pigs, none of them have spoken roles or even any visible scenes. There is little reference to the Rats having any form of society, and the narrator shows a clear bias in describing their existence as entirely barbaric.</p>
<p>Physical presence: Mice and Rats are both standard sizes, with dextrous paws capable of grasping and the ability to walk on four paws or two. The two main anthros are displayed</p>
<p>Communication: Communication occurs between all active players (People, Mice, Rats), but throughout the story the narrator reinforces that communications between anthros and humans is &#8220;simply not done.&#8221; </p>
<p>Read this book if you like mice or rat anthros, but aren&#8217;t tired of them after reading stories such as Stuart Little or The Secret of NIMH. Well-written characters and situations drive the story.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t read this book if you want a story with an indepth description of how mice are good and rats are evil. The moral black and white choices stare you in the face, and mature readers will spot the ending a mile away. The narrator also constantly bludgeons the reader over the head with the themes and emotions that are being expressed. However, the story is short enough that those sections read quickly and you can return to seeing anthros explore the world.</p>
<p>Personal Preference: Read it. There are far worse things you can do for an hour. Despereaux is adorables.</p>

			<p>I remember seeing the trailers for the movie version of this book and being unimpressed. I remain unsure as to what caused me feelings; perhaps it was the art style or the music. </p>
<p>While I was in a book shop for a whole day waiting for my car to be repaired, (a story to be told at another date,) I found a book called The Tale of Despereaux and thought it was time to make amends with the piece of respectable literature &#8211; one does not create a movie based upon literature without a passion for its writing.</p>
<p>After reading a few chapters, I was immensely bored, the scenes felt plodding and overly grandiose for reading&#8217;s sake, and the dialogue and characters felt chunky and overly described. I felt dissapointed; betrayed, even. Was this great literature? I scoffed and closed the book.</p>
<p>However, upon scowling at the cover, I recognized the words every adult reader of children&#8217;s literature is tormented with: &#8220;&#8230;based on the motion picture!&#8221;</p>
<p>I sighed with relief. This, while being the work of a great writer who worked hard at his or her craft, should not be judged as the original work. </p>
<p>Years later, I have come across a preowned version of the original Tale, formerly owned by a mister David Green, who I hope enjoyed this book as much as I did.</p>
<p>My review:</p>
<p>DiCamillo&#8217;s The Tale of Despereaux is not for those who shy from storyteller narrators. The narrator of this story looms over this story, describing the themes in intricate detail for simple-minded readers (also known as anyone who poorly analyzed Shakespeare back in high school). However, descriptions of characters are refreshingly light, giving just enough detail to understand characters without becoming droning and tiresome.</p>
<p>Along with the titular mouse, the story&#8217;s other primary anthropomorphic rat resident, Chiaroscuro (referred to as Roscuro) becomes the villain in a tragic fish out of water/racism is bad series of events, leading him to seek revenge upon Princess Pea using a MacGuffin character known as Migs. The story uses the structure of four separate books, the first three following Des, Roscuro, and Migs wit the fourth chronically the events which bring them all together.</p>
<p>Anthro Content:</p>
<p>Animal Society: The story only anthros Rats and Mice. While other animals are referred to, such as sheep, hens, and pigs, none of them have spoken roles or even any visible scenes. There is little reference to the Rats having any form of society, and the narrator shows a clear bias in describing their existence as entirely barbaric.</p>
<p>Physical presence: Mice and Rats are both standard sizes, with dextrous paws capable of grasping and the ability to walk on four paws or two. The two main anthros are displayed</p>
<p>Communication: Communication occurs between all active players (People, Mice, Rats), but throughout the story the narrator reinforces that communications between anthros and humans is &#8220;simply not done.&#8221; </p>
<p>Read this book if you like mice or rat anthros, but aren&#8217;t tired of them after reading stories such as Stuart Little or The Secret of NIMH. Well-written characters and situations drive the story.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t read this book if you want a story with an indepth description of how mice are good and rats are evil. The moral black and white choices stare you in the face, and mature readers will spot the ending a mile away. The narrator also constantly bludgeons the reader over the head with the themes and emotions that are being expressed. However, the story is short enough that those sections read quickly and you can return to seeing anthros explore the world.</p>
<p>Personal Preference: Read it. There are far worse things you can do for an hour. Despereaux is adorables.</p>
